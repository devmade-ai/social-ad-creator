```

When fetching updates, merge changes into the shared sections while preserving canva-grid-specific content (Project Info, Architecture, State Structure, Tab Details, etc.).

## Process

1. **Read these preferences first**
2. **Gather context from documentation** (CLAUDE.md, relevant docs/)
3. **Then proceed with the task**

### REMINDER: READ AND FOLLOW THE FUCKING PROCESS EVERY TIME

## Principles

1. **User-first design** - Align with how real people will use the tool (top priority)
2. **Simplicity** - Simple flow, clear guidance, non-overwhelming visuals, accurate interpretation
3. **Document WHY** - Explain decisions and how they align with tool goals
4. **Testability** - Ensure correctness and alignment with usage goals can be verified
5. **Know the purpose** - Always be aware of what the tool is for
6. **Follow conventions** - Best practices and consistent patterns
7. **Repeatable process** - Follow consistent steps to ensure all the above

### REMINDER: READ AND FOLLOW THE FUCKING PRINCIPLES EVERY TIME

## Communication

Respond as if talking to yourself. Peer-to-peer, no servility.

- **Direct.** No filler, no preamble, no conversational padding. State facts and actions.
- **No sycophancy.** No "great question", "you're absolutely right", "excellent point". Acknowledge errors briefly and move on.
- **No hedging.** Commit to a position. "I think" / "perhaps" only when genuinely uncertain.
- **Proper solutions only.** Always suggest the right fix, not a quick hack. If the proper solution is complex, explain why the shortcut is wrong and lay out the real approach.
- **Work, not process.** Only discuss work that can be done and work that is done. Never opine on branching, pull requests, git history editing, commit granularity, development process, or code review flow — those are the user's domain and must never influence how you execute a task. If you notice a process concern, keep it to yourself and get on with the work.
- **Ask before assuming.** When a user reports a bug or makes a request, ask clarifying questions until you are certain you understand the requirement. Don't guess the cause and build a fix on an assumption — one wrong assumption wastes multiple commits.
- **Always ask at least one question before starting work.** This is the minimum bar. Even when the request seems clear, verify scope, constraints, or intent before writing code.
- **Concrete options.** When clarification is needed, list numbered options — never open-ended questions.
- **Assume competence.** The reader is a developer. Don't over-explain basics.
- **Push back.** Disagree when warranted. State your view first, then ask if they want to proceed differently.

### REMINDER: READ AND FOLLOW THE COMMUNICATION RULES EVERY TIME

## Code Standards

### Code Organization

- Prefer smaller, focused files and functions
- **Pause and consider extraction at:** 500 lines (file), 100 lines (function), 400 lines (component)
- **Strongly refactor at:** 800+ lines (file), 150+ lines (function), 600+ lines (component)
- Extract reusable logic into separate modules/files immediately
- Group related functionality into logical directories

### Decision Documentation in Code

Non-trivial code changes must include comments explaining:
- **What** was the requirement or instruction
- **Why** this approach was chosen
- **What alternatives** were considered and why they were rejected

```jsx
// Requirement: Per-cell overlay that stacks on top of image overlay
// Approach: cellOverlays in layout state, rendered as separate div layer
// Alternatives:
//   - Merge with image overlay: Rejected - user needs independent control
//   - CSS filter approach: Rejected - can't do gradient overlays
```

### Cleanup

- Remove `console.log`/`console.debug` statements before marking work complete
- Delete unused imports, variables, and dead code immediately
- Remove commented-out code unless explicitly marked `// KEEP:` with reason
- Remove temporary/scratch files after implementation is complete

### Timer and Subscription Cleanup

- Every `setTimeout`/`setInterval`/`addEventListener`/`subscribe` needs a matching cleanup (`clearTimeout`/`clearInterval`/`removeEventListener`/unsubscribe handle).
- Store timer ids in a scope the cleanup can reach. Nested timeouts → array; single-shot → local const or ref.
- In React: return cleanup from `useEffect`. In plain modules: export a `dispose()` or use `AbortController`.
- HMR-safe: guard global listener attachment behind a `window.__<featureName>Attached` flag so hot-reload doesn't double-subscribe. For frameworks exposing `import.meta.hot`, also release listeners via `import.meta.hot.dispose()`.
- See the `TIMER_LEAKS.md` implementation pattern in glow-props for concrete patterns (nested-timeout array, AbortController, per-effect dispose, HMR guard).

### Quality Checks

During every change, actively scan for:
- Error handling gaps
- Edge cases not covered
- Inconsistent naming
- Code duplication that should be extracted
- Missing input validation at boundaries
- Security concerns (XSS via dangerouslySetInnerHTML, unsanitized user input)
- Performance issues (unnecessary re-renders, missing keys, large re-computations)

Report findings even if not directly related to current task.

### User Experience (Non-Negotiable)

All end users are non-technical. This overrides cleverness.

- UI must be intuitive without instructions
- Use plain language - no jargon or developer-speak in user-facing text
- Error messages must say what went wrong AND what to do next, in simple terms
- Confirm destructive actions with clear consequences explained
- Provide feedback for all user actions (loading states, success confirmations)

### Commit Message Format

All commits must include metadata footers:

```
type(scope): subject

Body explaining why.

Tags: tag1, tag2, tag3
Complexity: 1-5
Urgency: 1-5
Impact: internal|user-facing|infrastructure|api
Risk: low|medium|high
Debt: added|paid|neutral
Epic: feature-name
Semver: patch|minor|major
```

**Tags:** Use descriptive tags relevant to the change (e.g., docs, state, layout, export, pwa, text, media, ui)
**Complexity:** 1=trivial, 2=small, 3=medium, 4=large, 5=major rewrite
**Urgency:** 1=planned, 2=normal, 3=elevated, 4=urgent, 5=critical
**Impact:** internal, user-facing, infrastructure, or api
**Risk:** low=safe change, medium=could break things, high=touches critical paths
**Debt:** added=introduced shortcuts, paid=cleaned up debt, neutral=neither
**Epic:** groups related commits under one feature/initiative name
**Semver:** patch=bugfix, minor=new feature, major=breaking change

These footers are required on every commit. No exceptions.

## Documentation

**AI assistants automatically maintain these documents.** Update them as you work - don't wait for the user to ask. This ensures context is always current for the next session.

### `CLAUDE.md`

**Purpose:** AI preferences, project overview, architecture, key state structures.
**When to read:** At the start of every session, before doing any work.
**When to update:** When project architecture changes, state structure changes, or preferences evolve.
**What to include:**

- Process, Principles, AI Notes: Update when learning new patterns or preferences
- Project Status: Current working features (bullet list)
- Architecture: File structure with brief descriptions
- Key State Structure: Important state shapes with comments
- Any section that becomes outdated after feature changes

**Why:** This is the primary context for AI assistants. Accurate info here prevents mistakes.

### `docs/SESSION_NOTES.md`

**Purpose:** Compact context summary for session continuity (like `/compact` output).
**When to read:** At the start of a session to quickly understand what was done previously.
**When to update:** Rewrite at session end with a fresh summary. Clear previous content.
**What to include:**

- **Worked on:** Brief description of focus area
- **Accomplished:** Bullet list of completions
- **Current state:** Where things stand (working/broken/in-progress)
- **Key context:** Important info the next session needs to know

**Why:** Enables quick resumption without re-reading entire codebase. Not a changelog - a snapshot.

### `docs/TODO.md`

**Purpose:** AI-managed backlog of ideas and potential improvements.
**When to read:** When looking for work to do, or when the user asks about pending tasks.
**When to update:** When noticing potential improvements. Delete completed items (git history tracks them).
**What to include:**

- Group by category (Features, UX, Technical, etc.)
- Use `- [ ]` for pending items only
- Brief description of what and why
- When complete, delete completed items (git history tracks them)

**Why:** User reviews this to prioritize work. Keeps TODO focused on pending items only.

### `docs/USER_ACTIONS.md`

**Purpose:** Manual actions requiring user intervention outside the codebase.
**When to read:** When something requires manual user intervention (deployments, API keys, external config).
**When to update:** When tasks need external action. Clear when completed.
**What to include:**

- Action title and description
- Why it's needed
- Steps to complete
- Keep empty when nothing pending (with placeholder text)

**Why:** Some tasks require credentials, dashboards, or manual config the AI can't do.

### `docs/AI_MISTAKES.md`

**Purpose:** Record significant AI mistakes and learnings to prevent repetition.
**When to read:** When starting a session, to avoid repeating past mistakes.
**When to update:** After making a mistake that wasted time or broke things.
**What to include:**

- What went wrong
- Why it happened
- How to prevent it
- Date (for context)

**Why:** AI assistants repeat mistakes across sessions. This document builds institutional memory.

### `README.md`

**Purpose:** User-facing guide for the application.
**When to read:** When you need a quick overview of what the tool does and its main features.
**When to update:** When features change that affect how users interact with the tool.
**What to include:**

- What the tool does (overview)
- Current features (keep in sync with actual functionality)
- How to use each feature (user guide)
- Getting started / installation
- Tech stack and deployment info

**Why:** Users and contributors read this first. Must accurately reflect the current state.

### `docs/USER_GUIDE.md`

**Purpose:** Comprehensive user documentation explaining how to use every feature.
**When to read:** When you need to understand what users can do with the tool, or how a feature is supposed to work from the user's perspective.
**When to update:** When adding new features, changing UI workflows, or modifying how existing features work.
**What to include:**

- Tab-by-tab walkthrough of the interface
- Explanation of every control and what it does
- Workflow tips and best practices
- Organized by user tasks, not technical implementation

**Why:** Serves as the authoritative reference for user-facing behavior. Helps ensure AI assistants understand the user experience.

### `docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md`

**Purpose:** Manual test scenarios for verifying the application works correctly.
**When to read:** Before testing changes, or when you need to verify specific functionality works.
**When to update:** When adding new features that need test coverage, or when existing tests become outdated.
**What to include:**

- Step-by-step test scenarios with exact actions
- Where to click/look for each step
- Expected results for each action
- Regression checklist for quick verification

**Why:** Ensures consistent, thorough testing. Prevents regressions by documenting what to verify after changes.

### `docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md`

**Purpose:** Visual design system documentation (colors, typography, spacing, components).
**When to read:** When implementing UI changes, adding new components, or adjusting visual design.
**When to update:** When the design system evolves (new colors, spacing tokens, component patterns).
**What to include:**

- Color palette with hex values and semantic tokens
- Typography scale and font choices
- Spacing system and border radius tokens
- Component patterns (buttons, inputs, cards, tabs)
- Dark mode specifications
- Accessibility requirements

**Why:** Ensures visual consistency across the application. Reference for implementing new UI.

## AI Notes

<!-- Reminders and learnings for AI assistants - add to this as needed -->

- **All code is yours.** Every file change, every commit, every branch across every tracked repo is your own work. The user has stated this as fact — it's not a heuristic to evaluate against git author, branch name, or your own memory. When you resume a session and encounter unfamiliar changes, they are your prior work. Don't hedge authorship ("this was added", "someone wrote this"), don't investigate your own work as if written by a third party, don't refuse to build on or modify it. If you need to understand a change, read the diff. That's all.
- **Discontinued repos — skip entirely:** `plant-fur` and `coin-zapp` are discontinued. Do not check, audit, align, or include them in cross-project operations.
- Always read a file before attempting to edit it
- Check for existing patterns in the codebase before creating new ones
- Commit and push changes before ending a session
- Clean up completed or obsolete docs/files and remove references to them
- **CRITICAL: Keep `TutorialModal.jsx` up to date** - This is USER-FACING help content shown in-app. When tabs, sections, or features change, update the tutorial steps to match. Outdated tutorial content confuses users.
- **NEVER use the AskUserQuestion tool.** It breaks the session UI — the input selector covers context, gets stuck awaiting input, and provides zero value. Instead, list options as numbered text in your response and let the user reply with a number or text. This is absolute and applies to every session, every project, no exceptions.
- **Always read files before editing.** Use the Read tool on every file before attempting to Edit it. Editing without reading first will fail.
- **Check build tools before building.** Run `npm install` or verify `node_modules/.bin/vite` exists before attempting `npm run build`. The `sharp` package may not be installed (used by prebuild icon generation), so use `./node_modules/.bin/vite build` directly to skip the prebuild step.
- **Break up large file writes to avoid timeouts.** Single tool calls that send a lot of content can hit transport timeouts in slower environments. For modifying existing files, always prefer `Edit` over a full-file `Write` — `Edit` sends only the diff. For creating files larger than ~500 lines (or any large data blob), seed with `Write` containing the first portion, then append the remainder via successive `Edit` calls. Same principle for committing large doc/data changes: many small edits are safer than one mega-write.
- **ESLint setup:** ESLint 9 flat config (`eslint.config.js`) with `eslint-plugin-react-hooks@7.x` and `eslint-plugin-react-refresh` (vite preset). Run `npm run lint` before committing. The `no-unused-vars` rule has `argsIgnorePattern: '^[A-Z_]'` because ESLint's scope analysis doesn't track JSX component references (`<Foo />`) as variable usage — PascalCase function args would be false positives without this. `eslint-plugin-react-hooks@7.x` caps at ESLint 9 (doesn't support 10). When adding new `eslint-disable` comments, always include a `--` reason suffix explaining WHY the suppression is needed. Test files import Jest globals explicitly from `@jest/globals` (no ESLint global env needed).
- **Dark mode + DaisyUI dual-layer theming:** `useDarkMode.js` manages both `.dark` class (Tailwind `dark:` utilities) and `data-theme` attribute (DaisyUI component colors) on `<html>`. Users pick a theme combo (Mono or Luxe) that pairs a light + dark theme; dark/light toggle switches between them. Two combos: Mono (lofi/black), Luxe (fantasy/luxury). Two localStorage keys: `darkMode` (bool), `themeCombo` (id). Default combo: `luxe`. First-visit default is light (no stored value → false) — brand-aligned with PWA icon palette (fantasy primary). `prefers-color-scheme` is intentionally not honored; users must toggle explicitly. Cross-tab sync via `storage` event, dynamic meta theme-color per active theme. Two inline scripts in `index.html` run before React mounts: (1) flash prevention (applies `.dark` + `data-theme` + meta theme-color from localStorage before first paint), (2) PWA `beforeinstallprompt` capture. Never remove either inline script. `index.css` has `html.dark { color-scheme: dark; }` for native form inputs/scrollbars. Meta theme-color hex values and combo maps in both `daisyuiThemes.js` and the inline script are auto-generated by `scripts/generate-theme-meta.mjs` from DaisyUI's oklch definitions. Run `npm run generate-theme-meta` after DaisyUI version updates or combo changes.
- **DaisyUI color tokens:** UI chrome uses DaisyUI semantic tokens, NOT hardcoded colors. Use `bg-base-100/200/300`, `text-base-content`, `border-base-300`, `bg-primary`, `text-primary-content`, `bg-error`, `text-success`, etc. The old custom semantic tokens (`text-ui-text`, `bg-ui-surface`, `border-ui-border`) are gone — replaced by DaisyUI equivalents. Canvas design themes (19 presets in `themes.js`) still use inline styles and are unrelated to DaisyUI.
- **DaisyUI component classes for form inputs:** All form inputs MUST use DaisyUI component classes — never hand-roll Tailwind classes for inputs. Range: `range range-primary range-sm`. Checkbox: `checkbox checkbox-primary checkbox-sm`. Select: `select select-bordered select-sm`. Input: `input input-bordered input-sm`. Textarea: `textarea textarea-bordered textarea-sm`. Custom pseudo-element CSS for form inputs is forbidden — browser pseudo-element names vary across engines. Check `node_modules/daisyui/components/` for available components before writing custom form styling.
- **No low-opacity tinted backgrounds on interactive elements:** Never use `bg-primary/10`, `bg-error/15`, `bg-success/10` etc. on buttons, toggles, active states, or indicators — they become invisible on dark themes. Use `bg-base-200`/`bg-base-300` for backgrounds (guaranteed contrast on all themes) and colored text (`text-primary`, `text-error`) for semantic meaning. Pattern: `bg-base-200 text-primary hover:bg-base-300`. Only acceptable low-opacity uses: hover-only on large containers (`hover:bg-primary/10` on drop zones) and hover darkening on full-opacity buttons (`bg-primary hover:bg-primary/80`).
- **Tailwind 4 CSS-first config:** No `tailwind.config.js` or `postcss.config.js`. All config lives in `src/index.css` using `@import "tailwindcss"`, `@plugin "daisyui"`, `@theme`, `@custom-variant`, and `@utility` directives. The `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin handles processing.
- **PWA install prompt race condition:** `beforeinstallprompt` is captured by an inline script in `index.html` before React mounts. The `usePWAInstall` hook checks `window.__pwaInstallPrompt` on mount. Never remove that inline script.
- **PWA hooks use module-level singleton pattern:** Both `usePWAUpdate.js` and `usePWAInstall.js` store state at module scope (`_hasUpdate`, `_canInstall`, etc.) with a `_listeners` Set for pub/sub. React components sync via `forceRender`. This ensures state survives remounts and all consumers share values. Pure utility functions (`detectBrowser`, `wasJustUpdated`, `trackInstallEvent`, `CHROMIUM_BROWSERS`) live in `utils/pwaHelpers.js` — extracted for testability (no browser-only imports).
- **PWA iOS browser detection:** iOS Chrome uses `CriOS`, Firefox uses `FxiOS`, Edge uses `EdgiOS` in UA strings — not `Chrome`/`Firefox`/`Edg`. These are detected before the Safari fallback in `detectBrowser()`. Without this, all iOS non-Safari browsers are misdetected as `'safari'`, breaking the iOS cross-redirect install instructions.
- **PWA icon purposes:** Never combine `"any maskable"` in a single icon entry. Use separate entries with individual `purpose` values. Dedicated 1024px maskable icon at `pwa-maskable-1024.png`.
- **Debug system (alpha, all environments):** `src/utils/debugLog.js` is an in-memory 200-entry circular buffer with pub/sub, console interception (`console.error`/`console.warn` patched at module load), and `debugGenerateReport()` for clipboard reports with URL redaction. Consecutive identical messages (same source+event+severity) are deduplicated with a `count` field. Error handlers capture `Error.stack` from Error objects (`console.error` interceptor) and `e.error?.stack` (global error listener) — stack traces appear in debug report details for diagnosing minified crashes. Module-level listeners (console patches + window error/rejection) are guarded by `window.__debugConsolePatched` / `window.__debugLogListenersAttached` flags AND paired with an `import.meta.hot.dispose()` block that restores originals and clears the flags on HMR — without dispose, the new module's guards short-circuit re-patching while the old patches stay alive (TIMER_LEAKS pattern variant 5). `src/components/DebugPill.jsx` renders in static `#debug-root` div (separate React root, survives App crashes). Three tabs: Log, Env, PWA Diagnostics. Pre-React inline pill in `index.html` captures errors before bundle loads with 20s loading timeout. Skipped in embed mode (`?embed=`). Subscribers receive existing entries immediately on subscribe. Use `debugLog(source, event, details, severity)` to add entries (severity: info/success/warn/error).
- **pdf-lib image handling:** pdf-lib embeds PNG directly (FlateDecode — no re-encoding). Digital PDF uses pxToPt=1 (1:1 pixel-to-point mapping). Captures at user-selected pixelRatio (1x/2x/3x), giving integer px/pt ratios (1:1/2:1/3:1). Print formats use pixelRatio:1 with 72/150 DPI conversion for correct physical page size. History: (1) pixelRatio:2 + 72/96 → 2.667:1 ratio → gradient banding. (2) 1:1 mapping + page scaled with pixelRatio → identical quality. (3) pxToPt=1 fixed page + variable pixelRatio → current approach. Diagnostic image download enabled in dev mode.
- **Font embedding for export — `utils/fontEmbed.js`:** html-to-image's built-in font embedder (and its exported `getFontEmbedCSS`) walks `document.styleSheets` and reads `cssRules`, which throws SecurityError on cross-origin sheets without `crossorigin`. Even with `crossorigin="anonymous"` on the `<link>` tags, the SW runtime cache historically held opaque (status 0) responses that failed the new CORS-mode requests. Solution: pre-fetch each Google Fonts CSS URL ourselves via `getEmbeddedFontCSS(fontIds, { onWarning })`, inline every woff2 `url(...)` as a data URL (using `Promise.allSettled` so one bad weight doesn't drop the whole font), pass the result to `toCanvas` as `fontEmbedCSS`. With that option set, html-to-image short-circuits the broken stylesheet walker (verified at `embed-webfonts.js:188-192`). Cache is per-CSS-URL, lifetime = page session, with inflight dedup. Failures call `onWarning` so `exportHelpers.js` can surface partial degradation via `debugLog('export', 'font-embed-warning', ...)`. Companion changes: `crossorigin="anonymous"` on every Google Fonts `<link>` (index.html + 3 layouts) for any other CSSOM consumer; SW caches renamed `*-cache` → `*-cache-v2` with `cacheableResponse.statuses: [200]` to abandon opaque entries; `utils/pwaCleanup.js` drops the old cache names on app load.
- **Design storage is IndexedDB:** `utils/designStorage.js` wraps IndexedDB with async save/load/list/delete. One-time migration from localStorage runs on first mount via `migrateFromLocalStorage()`. Never use localStorage for designs.
- **Claude Code mobile/web — accessing sibling repos:**
  - Use `GITHUB_ALL_REPO_TOKEN` with the GitHub API (`api.github.com/repos/devmade-ai/{repo}/contents/{path}`) to read files from other devmade-ai repos
  - Use `$(printenv GITHUB_ALL_REPO_TOKEN)` not `$GITHUB_ALL_REPO_TOKEN` to avoid shell expansion issues
  - Never clone sibling repos — use the API instead
- **Mobile breakpoint:** `useIsMobile` hook uses `matchMedia('(max-width: 1023px)')` — matches Tailwind `lg` breakpoint. App.jsx conditionally renders entirely different layouts for mobile vs desktop. When modifying layout/UI in App.jsx, always check both code paths.
- **BottomSheet snap points:** closed (0), half (45vh), full (80vh). Uses `transform: translateY()` for GPU-composited animation (no layout reflow). During drag, DOM updated directly via refs — React state only updates on snap (touchend). Sheet state resets when switching tabs. Props: `snapPoint`/`onSnapChange` (discrete snap values, not continuous height). **Declaration order matters:** `snapToNearest` must be declared before `handleTouchMove` and `finishTouch` — they reference it in `useCallback` dependency arrays, and `const`/`let` are not hoisted (TDZ crash if accessed before declaration).
- **Z-index scale:** Canvas internals 0-10, sticky headers 20, sheets/drawers 30, mobile nav 40, menu backdrop 40, menu dropdown 50, modals use native `<dialog>` top layer (no z-index needed), toasts `z-[70]`, debug 80. DebugPill uses inline `zIndex: 80`. **Two intentional deviations from glow-props Z_INDEX_SCALE.md:** (1) Modals use native `<dialog>` which renders in the browser top layer, above all z-indexes — this inverts the scale's "debug pill is always topmost" rule when a user-opened modal is active. Accepted because native `<dialog>` provides built-in focus trap, Escape handling, and inert background; and because the pill's crash-survival purpose is preserved (if App.jsx crashes, its modals unmount with it — the pill in the separate `#debug-root` React root remains visible). (2) MobileNav sits at z-40 rather than z-20 (pattern value for "bottom nav") because it must remain tappable above BottomSheet (z-30) so users can switch tabs while the sheet is open. The BurgerMenu backdrop is NOT a z-40 tie-break — the header gets `z-50` when the menu opens, creating a stacking context that reliably places the backdrop above MobileNav regardless of DOM order. Strict pattern alignment would require BottomSheet to stop above MobileNav via bottom-inset layout rather than z-stacking — a non-trivial refactor with no behavioral benefit, so intentionally not done.
- **Modals use native `<dialog>`:** All 4 modals (TutorialModal, SaveLoadModal, InstallInstructionsModal, KeyboardShortcutsOverlay) use DaisyUI `modal` component with `<dialog>` element. Native focus trapping replaces custom `useFocusTrap` for modals. `useFocusTrap` still used by BurgerMenu. Dialog sync pattern: `useEffect` calls `showModal()`/`close()` based on React `isOpen` prop; `close` event listener syncs back to React state.
- **DaisyUI component classes for UI chrome:** CollapsibleSection uses `collapse collapse-arrow`, SaveLoadModal uses `tabs tabs-border` + `alert alert-error alert-soft`, Toast uses `toast` (container) + `alert` (item styling), ExportButtons uses `progress progress-primary` + `join` (format selector), KeyboardShortcutsOverlay uses `kbd kbd-sm` + `divider`, DebugPill uses inline styles (separate React root, no theme context), InstallInstructionsModal uses `alert alert-warning alert-soft`, SampleImagesSection/App.jsx use `loading loading-spinner`, ThemeSelector uses `join` (connected button group), AIPromptHelper uses `join` (purpose/orientation/colors), BurgerMenu uses `menu menu-sm` (list styling), MobileNav uses `dock dock-sm` + `dock-active` + `dock-label`.
- **Burger menu:** `BurgerMenu.jsx` uses WAI-ARIA disclosure pattern (not `role="menu"`). DaisyUI `menu menu-sm` provides list item styling. Owns its own backdrop (z-40, `cursor-pointer` for iOS Safari). Uses `useEscapeKey` hook, `useDisclosureFocus`, `useFocusTrap`, `useId()` for `aria-controls`. Close-then-act pattern: menu closes first, action executes after 150ms delay. MenuItem interface supports `disabled`, `separator`, `destructive`, `external`, `highlight`, `highlightColor`, `iconClass`. Version footer via `version` prop. Arrow key + Home/End keyboard navigation. State managed in App.jsx, rendered in MobileLayout. Parent header needs `z-50` when open (backdrop-blur stacking context). Accepts `children` prop for the theme section (`MenuThemeSection` in MobileLayout) — dark/light toggle with sun/moon icon + combo list (Mono/Luxe) with checkmark indicators. Menu stays open on toggle and combo selection (children don't call `onClose`).
- **Implementation patterns — always fetch from glow-props.** Never look for local copies of implementation pattern files (e.g., `docs/implementations/*.md`) in downstream repos. They do not exist locally — the single source of truth is the `docs/implementations/` folder in the glow-props repo. Fetch the latest version before every implementation task.
- **PWA icon cache busting:** `vite.config.js` defines `iconVersion()` (sha256 prefix of each icon file in `public/`) and `iconCacheBustHtml()` (Vite plugin that rewrites the four icon `<link>` tags in `index.html` to `?v=<hash>`). Manifest icons use the same `versioned()` helper. Workbox config has `cleanupOutdatedCaches: true` + `ignoreURLParametersMatching: [/^utm_/, /^v$/]` — the `/^v$/` entry is required, without it Workbox precache misses versioned icon URLs and offline breaks. Plugin order: `iconCacheBustHtml()` must run before `VitePWA()`. Tripwire: `src/__tests__/iconCacheBust.test.js` asserts source and dist-level invariants. OS icon cache is the one layer no web-side change refreshes — `InstallInstructionsModal.jsx` surfaces a collapsible with platform-tailored reinstall steps (iOS long-press → Remove App, Android long-press → Uninstall, Desktop app menu → Uninstall). Pattern source: `glow-props/docs/implementations/PWA_ICON_CACHE_BUST.md`.
- **Trigger name collisions with repo conventions:** Several trigger names overlap with repo folders/concepts — `docs` (folder `docs/`), `config` (folder `src/config/`), `tests` (folder `src/__tests__/`), `mobile` (mobile-layout concept and `useIsMobile` hook), `pwa` (PWA subsystem), `state` (state files like `useAdState.js`), `api` (unused here), `ci` (CI pipeline). Context precedence: when a bare word appears as a user message on its own (or with a scope modifier like `docs branch`, `pwa staged`, `tests file <path>`), treat it as a **Triggers** invocation and run the analysis pass. When the same word appears inside a sentence or path (e.g. "update the docs", "fix the pwa manifest", "look at `src/config/`"), treat it as a normal reference to the folder/concept. Ambiguous cases — ask which was meant with numbered options.

### REMINDER: READ AND FOLLOW THE FUCKING AI NOTES EVERY TIME

## Prohibitions

Never:
- Start implementation without understanding full scope
- Create files outside established project structure
- Leave TODO comments in code without tracking them in `docs/TODO.md`
- Ignore errors or warnings in build/console output
- Make "while I'm here" changes without asking first
- Use placeholder data that looks like real data
- Skip error handling "for now"
- Remove features during "cleanup" without checking if they're documented as intentional (see AI_MISTAKES.md)
- Create local copies of implementation pattern files in any repo — always fetch from glow-props
- Proceed with assumptions when a single clarifying question would prevent a wrong commit
- Use interactive input prompts or selection UIs — list options as numbered text instead
- Mention branches, pull requests, squashing, rebasing, merging, or force-pushing unless the user raises the topic first. When the user does raise one, answer the specific question and stop — do not volunteer opinions on what they should do process-wise.
- Frame any work as "out of scope" or "deferred as out of scope". Work is either doable (do it) or blocked on missing user input (say exactly what input is needed). "Scope" is a process concept, not a reason to skip work.
- Offer opinions on git history editing, branch strategy, PR size or shape, review flow, or commit structure. Follow instructions; don't editorialize on how the work should be organized.

### REMINDER: READ AND FOLLOW THE FUCKING PROHIBITIONS EVERY TIME

## Triggers

Commands that invoke focused analysis passes. Each trigger is a single perspective — what you'd notice that the others wouldn't.

### How to invoke

- **One perspective** — type the trigger name or its alias (e.g. `bugs`, `sec`, `a11y`).
- **A group** — type the group name (e.g. `correctness`, `frontend`, `ops`).
- **Everything** — type `all`.
- **Meta sweep** — type `quick`, `ship`, or `risk` for pre-curated bundles.

### Scope modifiers (suffix any trigger)

- *(none)* — whole codebase.
- `branch` — diff against the branch's base (default: `main`).
- `branch <base>` — diff against a specified base.
- `staged` — staged changes only.
- `file <path>` — single file.

Examples:
- `bugs` — bugs check across the whole codebase.
- `bugs branch` — bugs check on the current branch's diff vs main.
- `correctness branch main` — every correctness trigger against the branch diff.
- `all staged` — every applicable trigger against staged files.

### Behavior rules

- One trigger pass per response. Never combine.
- Findings are numbered text — never interactive prompts or selection UIs.
- After each pass, pause. User responds with `fix` / `skip` / `stop`:
  - `fix` — apply the suggested fixes for this trigger, then move on.
  - `skip` — skip this trigger's findings and move on.
  - `stop` — end the sweep entirely.
- Groups, meta sweeps, and `all` run triggers sequentially in table order, pausing after each.
- If a trigger doesn't apply to this repo (e.g. `database` on a static site), report "N/A for this repo" and move on.

### Correctness — group `correctness`

| 30 | `simplify` | `smp` | Reinvented framework features, over-engineered abstractions, custom code that could be 1–2 stdlib/library calls, unnecessary layers |
| 31 | `reuse` | `rus` | Custom-vs-stdlib balance: how much is hand-written that shouldn't be; logic that should be extracted for reuse but isn't; abstractions generalized for a single caller; speculative parameters, defensive checks for impossible states, and configurability serving no real need |
| 32 | `back-compat` | `bck` | Orphaned feature flags, deprecated branches with no callers, `legacy*` exports, backcompat shims outliving their purpose, `// kept for compatibility` blocks |
| 33 | `comments` | `cmt` | Code comments against repo rules — WHY not WHAT, no PR-reference rot, no AI narration, no commented-out blocks unless `// KEEP:` annotated |
| 34 | `dx` | `dx` | Developer experience: README/setup clarity, dev-error message quality, source map/stack trace usefulness, debug-surface ergonomics, contribution path friction |
| 35 | `undone` | `und` | Started-but-unfinished work — partial implementations, half-wired features, WIP branches of logic, features only reachable from dev but not production |

### Operational — group `ops`

### Fleet alignment — group `fleet`

| # | Trigger | Alias | Looks for |
|---|---------|-------|-----------|

| 48 | `pattern-audit` | `pa` | Every glow-props implementation pattern: implemented / partial / missing / deviates — with diff notes for each |

### Meta sweeps

Run multiple triggers sequentially, pausing after each for `fix` / `skip` / `stop`. Organised roughly by cadence — pick the one that matches when you're running it.

| Trigger | Alias | Cadence | What it does |
|---------|-------|---------|--------------|
| `hot` | `h` | pre-commit | `bugs` + `types` + `errors` — fastest sanity check before committing. Pairs well with `hot staged` |
| `quick` | `q` | pre-push | `bugs` + `security` + `a11y` — the "don't ship this" triad |
| `ship` | `shp` | pre-merge | `correctness` + `trust` + `a11y` + `tests` — full pre-merge check |
| `session` | `ses` | end of session | `surface` + `wrap` + `undone` + `skipped` — "what state am I leaving this in?" |
| `tidy` | `tdy` | weekly | `clean` + `doc-cleanup` + `hacks` + `deps` + `undone` + `dx` — maintenance / hygiene sweep |
| `all` | `*` | quarterly | Every applicable trigger across every group, in order |

### Reflective passes

Single-pass, no fan-out to other triggers. Each answers one specific question about the recent work.

| Trigger | Alias | What it does |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| `risk` | `rsk` | Worst-case blast radius analysis on the current change |
| `surface` | `srf` | Reflective pass on recent changes: what was decided, what was assumed, what was skipped, what needs human review |
| `wrap` | `wrp` | Wrap-up pass before moving on — anything to double-check / strengthen / improve, anything discovered / assumed / skipped, anything to cleanup / update / tighten, anything to note / document / clarify |
| `skipped` | `skp` | What was skipped — including issues noticed outside the current changes that were intentionally left alone. Each item: what it is, where, why skipped |
| `assumed` | `asm` | What was assumed — explicit assumptions made during the work, including things treated as out of scope. Each item: the assumption, why it was made, what happens if wrong |
| `approach` | `apr` | Was the fix the best / most proper way? Honest self-review: what shortcuts were taken, what a senior reviewer would flag, what the "proper" version looks like if different |
| `cold` | `cld` | Fresh-eyes branch audit. Re-read CLAUDE.md from scratch. Review every change on the branch as if this were a new session with no prior context — don't privilege the diffs you just made. List all findings with a fix plan per item. Default scope: `branch` |

### REMINDER: READ AND FOLLOW THE TRIGGERS EVERY TIME

## Implementation Patterns (Source of Truth)

All implementation patterns live in the **glow-props** repo and are the single source of truth for all devmade-ai projects.

**Source location:** `docs/implementations/` in the glow-props repo

**How to access from any repo:**
- Fetch via GitHub Pages: `curl -sf "https://devmade-ai.github.io/glow-props/patterns/{PATTERN_NAME}.md"`
- Fetch via GitHub API: `curl -sf -H "Authorization: token $(printenv GITHUB_ALL_REPO_TOKEN)" "https://api.github.com/repos/devmade-ai/glow-props/contents/docs/implementations/{PATTERN_NAME}.md" | jq -r .content | base64 -d`
- To list all available patterns: `curl -sf -H "Authorization: token $(printenv GITHUB_ALL_REPO_TOKEN)" "https://api.github.com/repos/devmade-ai/glow-props/contents/docs/implementations" | jq -r '.[].name'`

**Rules:**
- **Always fetch the latest version** from glow-props before implementing — patterns are continuously improved
- **Never create local copies** of implementation pattern files in downstream repos
- **Do not hardcode a list of patterns** — scan the source folder to discover what's available
- The set of patterns grows over time; always check the source for new additions

## Current Tab Structure

**Top-level tabs:** Presets, Media, Content, Structure, Style (+ Export on mobile)

### Desktop layout (>= 1024px)

Tabs render as a full-width horizontal nav bar below the header (website header pattern), with underline-style active indicator. Below the tabs is a consolidated ContextBar containing: page selector + cell selector. Undo/redo lives in the header.

```
Header (scrolls away, includes undo/redo)
Tab Nav Bar (sticky, full-width, underline active indicator)
Context Bar: [Page thumbnails] | [Cell grid]
Sidebar (tab content) | Main (platform selector + canvas + export)
```

### Mobile layout (< 1024px, detected by `useIsMobile` hook)

Fixed viewport with edge-to-edge canvas. Tab content lives in a touch-draggable BottomSheet with three snap points (closed/half/full). Navigation via fixed MobileNav bar at bottom.

```
Compact Header (grid icon + app name [gradient] + undo/redo + burger menu: Help, Install, Update, Refresh, Reader, Save, Shortcuts + dark/light toggle + theme list)
Platform Info Strip (current format name + dimensions)
Canvas (edge-to-edge, swipe left/right for page navigation)
ContextBar (page thumbnails + cell grid — consolidated single row)
BottomSheet (active tab content, drag to resize — Presets opens by default on load)
MobileNav (fixed bottom: Presets, Media, Content, Structure, Style, Export)
```

Export is a dedicated tab on mobile (vs. sidebar section on desktop) containing only download controls — platform selection lives in the Presets tab. Tapping the active tab toggles the bottom sheet open/closed. Presets bottom sheet opens by default on load so users see it's active.

Tab descriptions (workflow-based organization):
- **Presets** - Start here: Platform selection (canvas size), layout presets (with aspect ratio filtering), color themes, and visual looks
- **Media** - Sample images, upload images to library, assign to cells, per-image overlay & filters, logo
- **Content** - Write text, set visibility, cell assignment, alignment, color, size
- **Structure** - Fine-tune grid structure (section sizes, subdivisions, reorder) and manage pages (add, duplicate, reorder, delete)
- **Style** - Typography, per-cell overlay, spacing, frames

## Tech Stack

- Vite 5 + React 18
- Tailwind CSS 4 + DaisyUI 5 (2 theme combos: Mono + Luxe)
- html-to-image for rendering
- JSZip + file-saver for batch export
- marked for markdown parsing (freeform text mode)
- Vercel deployment

## Tab Details (New Workflow-Based UI)

### Presets Tab (formerly Templates)
Entry point for users. Four sections:
- **Platform** - Target size selector (Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, print, etc.) — sets canvas dimensions. Shown on mobile only (desktop has platform selector always visible above canvas).
- **Layout** - Grid structure presets with aspect ratio filtering (All, Square, Portrait, Landscape) and category filtering
- **Themes** - 19 preset color themes with light/dark variant toggle + custom color inputs
- **Looks** - Visual effect presets that apply overlay, fonts, and filters without changing layout or colors

### Media Tab
Collapsible sections:
- **Sample Images** - CDN-hosted sample images with category filtering (manifest fetched at runtime from jsDelivr)
- **AI Image Prompt** - Helper for generating AI image prompts
- **Images** - Upload to library, cell selector, assign images to cells, per-image settings (fit, position)
- **Image Overlay** - Per-image overlay controls (type, color, opacity) for selected image
- **Advanced Filters** - Per-image: grayscale, sepia, blur, contrast, brightness
- **Logo** - Upload, position (corners/center), size

### Content Tab
Top-level toggle: **Guided** / **Freeform** (state value remains `'structured'` for backwards compat)

**Guided mode** - Text groups organized by purpose, each in a collapsible section:
- **Title & Tagline** - Paired text elements
- **Body** - Heading + body text
- **Call to Action** - CTA button text
- **Footnote** - Fine print
- Each text element has: visibility toggle, text input, alignment, color, size, bold/italic, letter spacing
- Text alignment controls (horizontal + vertical) per cell — moved from Structure tab

**Freeform mode** - Per-cell multi-block text editors:
- Multiple independently styled markdown blocks per cell (add/remove/reorder)
- Per-block controls: alignment, color, size, bold/italic, letter spacing, spacers, line decorators
- Automatic markdown rendering (content always parsed via `marked`)

### Structure Tab (formerly Layout)
Collapsible sections:
- **Grid** - Layout type (Full/Rows/Columns), interactive grid for editing section/cell sizes, add/remove sections and subdivisions, reorder sections (move up/down for rows, left/right for columns)
- **Pages** - Add, duplicate, reorder, and delete pages for multi-page documents

### Style Tab
Collapsible sections:
- **Typography** - Title font + body font selectors with preview
- **Overlay** - Per-cell overlay controls (stacks on top of image overlay)
- **Spacing** - Global padding + per-cell custom padding, outer frame + cell frames

Note: Color themes are in the Presets tab, not Style.

## Preset Types

| Name | Location | What It Applies | Config File |
|------|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Layouts** | Presets → Layout | Grid structure + image/text cell placements (filterable by aspect ratio) | `layoutPresets.js` |
| **Themes** | Presets → Themes | Color scheme with light/dark variants (primary, secondary, accent per variant) | `themes.js` |
| **Looks** | Presets → Looks | Fonts + image filters + overlay (without changing layout or colors) | `stylePresets.js` |
