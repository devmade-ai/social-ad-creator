## Worked on
Created a fun, vibrant style guide for the Social Ad Creator

## Accomplished

- Created comprehensive `docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md` with creative design tokens
- Adapted corporate fintech style guide to be fun and energetic
- Key design decisions:
  - Primary palette: Electric Violet (#8B5CF6), Hot Pink (#EC4899), Cyber Cyan (#06B6D4)
  - Dark mode uses deep indigo (#0F0F23) instead of pure black
  - Gradient system for CTAs and accents
  - Typography: Space Grotesk for headlines, Inter for body
  - Motion guidelines with playful hover effects
- Committed and pushed to branch

## Current state
- **Build**: Not affected (documentation only)
- **Style guide**: Complete at `docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- **Implementation**: Style guide is documentation only — colors/components not yet implemented in the app

## Key context

- This is a reference document, not implemented code
- Could be used to guide future UI updates
- Existing app already has some vibrant themes (Vibrant, Neon, Candy) that align with this direction
- The style guide uses a systematic structure with creative energy
