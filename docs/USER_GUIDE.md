### Media Tab

- **Colors:** Use your current theme colors or enter custom color descriptions

**Generated Prompt:** The helper builds a complete prompt including:

Click **Copy** to copy the prompt to your clipboard for use in any AI image generator.

## Workflow Tips

### Fastest Workflow
1. Pick a Layout and Theme from the Presets tab
2. Upload your image in Media

4. Pick fonts (Style → Typography)
5. Add overlays to improve text readability (Style → Overlay)
6. Write your content (Content tab)
7. Export

### Making Text Readable
- Use **overlays** on cells with text over busy images
- **Gradient overlays** work well for text at edges
- **Solid overlays** with low opacity create subtle darkening

- Adjust **text color** to contrast with your overlay

### Using AI-Generated Images
1. Open **Media → AI Image Prompt** section
2. Describe your subject and choose style/mood
3. Select orientation (Landscape for banners, Portrait for stories, Square for posts)
4. Select "Background" purpose if you'll have text overlays
5. Optionally set a theme first (Presets → Themes) to include your colors
6. Click **Copy** and paste into your AI image generator
7. Upload the generated image back into the tool

### Working with Layouts
- **Full Bleed:** Best for single-message ads with large text
- **Rows:** Good for separating image and text areas
- **Columns:** Creates side-by-side layouts
- Use **cell assignment** in Content tab to place text exactly where you want it
- Use **Structure tab** to fine-tune cell sizes and alignment

### Multi-Image Layouts
Some layouts support multiple images in different cells:
1. Upload all your images to the library (Media → Images)
2. Select an image by clicking it in the library
3. Use the "Assign to Cells" mini-grid to assign it to cells
4. Repeat for each image you want to place
5. Each image can have its own fit, position, overlay, and filter settings
