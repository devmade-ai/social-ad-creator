1. **Presets** - Start here with layouts, themes, and looks
2. **Media** - Upload your images and logo
3. **Content** - Write your text, configure visibility, set alignment
4. **Structure** - Adjust the grid structure, reorder sections
5. **Style** - Customize fonts, overlays, and spacing

## Context Bar

A compact sticky bar below the tab navigation for quick selection:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Page Selector** | Page thumbnails for switching between pages (visible when 2+ pages exist) |
| **Cell Selector** | Miniature layout grid showing cells — click to select a cell for editing |

Undo/Redo buttons are in the **header** for constant visibility. Page management controls (add, duplicate, reorder, delete) are in the **Structure tab**.

The selected cell in the Context Bar affects controls in Media, Content, and Style tabs.

**Aspect Ratio Filter:** Filter layouts by aspect ratio (All, Square, Portrait, Landscape) to find layouts that work best for your target platform.

**Category Filter:** Browse by category (All, Suggested, Classic, Split, Stacked, etc.) to find the right layout style.

**How to use:** Click a look to apply its visual effects. Your layout and theme colors are preserved.

### Media Tab

- **Style:** Choose a visual style (Photo, Cinematic, Editorial, Minimal, Abstract, Illustration, 3D)
- **Mood / Lighting:** Set the atmosphere (Dark, Light, Neutral, Dramatic, Soft, Warm, Cool)

  - **Background:** Subtle details, optimized for text overlays
- **Orientation:** Landscape, Portrait, or Square (choose based on your target platforms)
- **Colors:** Use your current theme colors or enter custom color descriptions

**Generated Prompt:** The helper builds a complete prompt including:
- Your style and mood preferences
- Color palette from your theme
- Selected orientation
- **Automatic constraints:** "no text, no overlays" - ensures clean images ready for your ad

Click **Copy** to copy the prompt to your clipboard for use in any AI image generator.

#### Images

## Workflow Tips

### Fastest Workflow

### Custom Design Workflow
1. Upload your image first (Media tab)

3. Choose your theme colors (Presets → Themes)
4. Pick fonts (Style → Typography)
5. Add overlays to improve text readability (Style → Overlay)
6. Write your content (Content tab)

### Making Text Readable
- Use **overlays** on cells with text over busy images
- **Gradient overlays** work well for text at edges
- **Solid overlays** with low opacity create subtle darkening

- Adjust **text color** to contrast with your overlay

### Using AI-Generated Images
1. Open **Media → AI Image Prompt** section
2. Describe your subject and choose style/mood
3. Select orientation (Landscape for banners, Portrait for stories, Square for posts)
4. Select "Background" purpose if you'll have text overlays

6. Click **Copy** and paste into your AI image generator
7. Upload the generated image back into the tool

### Mobile Tips
- **Long-press a cell** on the canvas to open a context menu that lets you quickly jump to Media, Content, or Style tabs for that cell.
- Swipe left/right on the canvas to navigate between pages in multi-page documents.

### Working with Layouts
- **Full Bleed:** Best for single-message ads with large text
- **Rows:** Good for separating image and text areas
- **Columns:** Creates side-by-side layouts
- Use **cell assignment** in Content tab to place text exactly where you want it
- Use **Structure tab** to fine-tune cell sizes and alignment

### Multi-Image Layouts
Some layouts support multiple images in different cells:
1. Upload all your images to the library (Media → Images)
2. Select an image by clicking it in the library
3. Use the "Assign to Cells" mini-grid to assign it to cells
4. Repeat for each image you want to place
5. Each image can have its own fit, position, overlay, and filter settings
